# bad-apple-on-discord
A C++ file that converts the famous bad apple youtube video into ascii and prints it to discord.
# Warning
This is one of my worst idea's ever. Please refrain from using this. I created this without the use of OpenCV video processing library so it sucks. I used a past image processing library I made and converted the video into ascii and pasted it to discord. This works by splicing the bad apple video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtutLA63Cp8) into 1097 different png's and converting each one seperatley. Yes, I know very stupid of me. But it works without the use of OpenCV.
